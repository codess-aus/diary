[08:42:46] Copilot said to me “Change isn’t coming—it’s uploading. And we’re the ones coding what’s next.” Can't decide if that's deep or dark
[08:47:15] Copilot said “Change is like a game update—new levels, new powers, and you’re the player one!”
[08:48:54] Copilot said “Change is just a line of code away—debug the past, compile the future.”
[08:57:24] Copilot said “Change doesn’t scare us—we swipe, tap, and code it into being.”
[08:58:00] Copilot said “We don’t just dream of better—we design it, test it, and launch it.”
[09:00:38] Copilot said “We’re not here to fit in—we’re here to fix things, flip things, and make the world better"
[09:01:10] Copilot said “We don’t just scroll through the future—we code it, remix it, and make it sparkle.”
